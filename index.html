      <h2>Build and scale real-time applications.</h2>

      <p>
        Stop using AJAX polling and Comet to replicate a TCP connection, and
        just use one. Alchemy takes care of the guts of socket programming and
        leaves you with what you care about - your application. Alchemy handles
        breaking itself out into threads and scaling, allowing you to handle
        hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections on modest hardware;
        all this, and you only have to care about a few lines of code.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      
      <pre class="prettyprint">
//...refs
using Alchemy;
using Alchemy.Classes;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  // instantiate a new server - acceptable port and IP range,
  // and set up your methods.

  var aServer = new WebSocketServer(81, IPAddress.Any) {
    OnReceive = OnReceive,
    OnSend = OnSend,
    OnConnect = OnConnect,
    OnConnected = OnConnected,
    OnDisconnect = OnDisconnect,
    TimeOut = new TimeSpan(0, 5, 0)
  };

  aServer.Start();
}

static void OnConnected(UserContext context)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Client Connection From : " +
  aContext.ClientAddress.ToString());
}

//...etc
      </pre>

      <p>
        You can run Alchemy Websockets as a console application, Windows service, Linux
        daemon under Mono, or any configuration that works best for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alchemy Websockets is <strong><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Alchemy">available as a NuGet package</a></strong> (as of May 31.)
        Alternatively, Alchemy Websockets is a Visual Studio 2010 project. It can be loaded in the free
        Visual C# Express and Monodevelop as well (and potentially other compatible IDEs.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Alchemy Websockets runs in <strong>Mono</strong> and Windows 
        <strong>.NET environments</strong>. It officially supports 
        <strong>hybi-00, hybi-10, hybi-17, and the official RFC6455</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use Alchemy Websockets as a client to connect to other WebSocket
        servers using the RFC6455 protocol; this allows you to build servers 
        communicating with each other.
      </p>

      <h3>Setting up Alchemy Websockets as a Client</h3>

      <pre class="prettyprint">
//...refs
using Alchemy;
using Alchemy.Classes;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  var aClient = new WebSocketClient("ws://alchemywebsockets.net:81/chat"){
    OnReceive = OnReceive,
    OnSend = OnSend,
    OnConnect = OnConnected,
    OnConnected = OnConnect,
    OnDisconnect = OnDisconnect
  });

  aClient.Connect();
  aClient.Send("Hey!"); // string or byte[]
  aClient.Disconnect();
}

static void OnReceive(UserContext context)
{
  Console.WriteLine("The server said : " + context.DataFrame.ToString());
}

//...etc
      </pre>


      <h2>Example Project</h2>

      <p>An example application can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets-Example">alchemy-websockets-example</a></p>

      <h2>Client Library</h2>

      <p>
        The client library is not necessary; it simply provides a helpful abstraction for older websockets that handles
        a flash fallback using websocket-js.  You can download the client javascript library at
        <a href="https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets-Client-Library">alchemy-websockets-client-library</a>.

        <h4>Real-World Uses</h4>

        <h5>Online Gaming</h5>

        <blockquote>
          For communication between the html 5 client and the game
          server we use WebSockets (Alchemy). The main reason is 
          compatibility, and the fact that WebSocket enables bidirectional
          communication, which will minimise the network traffic.
          Testing Alchemy I saw that is very nice and simple to 
          use on the server side (C#) 
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          We're rebuilding our online game to use WebSockets instead of ajax
          polling; it's much simpler and more efficient. We're using Lua to
          build the game in the back-end because it works with C# so easily;
          the Alchemy instances communicate with the Lua nodes to return results
          of game commands, which are then sent back to the html 5 / Backbone.js
          web clients.
